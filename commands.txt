find <directory> -type f -print0 | sort -zR | head -zn 35 | xargs -0 rm # randomly delete exactly 35 files from a directory

#     Lists all files in the specified directory using find.
#     Shuffles the file list randomly using sort -zR.
#     Selects the first 35 files from the shuffled list using head -zn 35.
#     Deletes the selected files using xargs -0 rm
